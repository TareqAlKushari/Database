# Database

A lightweight and versatile database management system designed for simplicity, flexibility, and educational purposes.

## Overview

**@TareqAlKushari/Database** is a project that aims to provide a basic yet functional database system implementation. It is ideal for learning, prototyping, or lightweight projects where a full-featured DBMS is not required.

## Features

- Basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations
- Simple query interface
- Easy-to-understand codebase for educational exploration
- Modular design for extensibility
- Lightweight and minimal dependencies

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (if this is a Node.js project)
- (Or specify other required environments, e.g., Python, C++ compiler, etc.)

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TareqAlKushari/Database.git
cd Database
```

Install dependencies (if any):

```bash
npm install
```
or
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
*(Adjust commands as appropriate for your language/environment)*

### Usage

Import and use the database module in your project:

#### Example (Node.js/JavaScript)

```javascript
const Database = require('./database');
// Initialize and use the database
const db = new Database();
db.insert({ key: 'value' });
```

#### Example (Python)

```python
from database import Database
db = Database()
db.insert({'key': 'value'})
```

*(Adjust usage examples depending on your implementation language and API)*
